## TOGAF Reference Models

An architecture reference model is an abstract framework or domain-specific ontology consisting of an interlinked set of clearly defined concepts produced by an expert or body of experts in order to encourage clear communication. This frame of reference can then be used to communicate ideas clearly among members of the architecture and/or delivery community.

By default, our approach to architecture reference models will follow the approach described in the [TOGAF standard, version 9.1, part VI](http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/toc-pt6.html). If necessary, a reference model may deviate from the default approach, but, if so, the reason for this deviation will be documented as a part of the model.

Each relevant reference model will be documented and those documents will be stored in our architecture repository, within the reference library. As such, version controls will be applied to each reference model. A template will be produced to support the creation of new architecture reference models.

By default an architecture reference model will include the following sections:

- *Role*: the purpose of the reference model will be clearly documented;
- *Scope*: the applicability of the reference model will be documented (for example Foundation / Common Systems / Industry / Org-specific)
- *Owner*: the owner of reference model will be specified, along with other responsible parties, using a RACI matrix;
- *Taxonomy*: the terminology related to the model will be defined and components that make up the model will be described along with their conceptual structure;
- *Graphic*: one or more diagrams will be included in order to support understanding and provide a visual representation of the taxonomy;
- *Discussion*: any relevant additional points regarding the model will considered. For example:
    - what are the implications of following this model?
    - why would you choose this model over other similar or related models?

In some cases we may choose to re-use existing third party architecture reference models. Where this approach is taken (and the effort required is not prohibitive) we will translate the model into the above format, for consistency.

Having reviewed the existing TOGAF reference models (Technical Reference Model (TRM) and Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM)) we do not anticipate that they will be re-used as a part of architecture definition activity. In the future we do plan to update existing reference models as well as define new reference models through continuous improvement and domain engineering processes.
