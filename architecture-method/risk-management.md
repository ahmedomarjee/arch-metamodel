# Risk Management

A good quality risk management process is an important element in the delivery of nearly every successful project or programme. This is especially true for projects or programmes that include a significant architectural or digital transformation activity.

The Scottish Government (SG) has a mature, well documented approach to the management of risk that is well understood and is successfully implemented across the organisation. This approach is aligned and integrated with the organisation's overall approach to project and programme management and is the preferred approach of the Office of the CIO (OCIO). The risk management approach is based on industry standard as well as HMG risk guidance and covers similar topics to the TOGAF approach, namely:

- Risk identification;
- Risk classification;
- Risk assessment;
- Risk mitigation;
- Risk monitoring and reporting.

As such, our enterprise and systems architecture framework will re-use the Scottish Government approach rather than the TOGAF approach. This will include use of SG process and procedures, SG document templates and, importantly, SG taxonomy.


## Recommendations

Having operated SG risk management within the context of enterprise and systems architecture we would make the following recommendations:

- Aim to manage a unified risk log rather than a separate architectural risk log – this significantly simplifies monitoring and reporting;
- Agree a simple way to classify technical and architectural risks so that they can be filtered from the full log, if necessary;
- In many cases technical / architecture risk management is relevant to a different group of stakeholders from project / programme risk – it is often more productive to run a separate risk management session for technical stakeholders;
- Make the effort early to identify objective criteria for the classification of risks such that both the likelihood and impact of architectural and other programme risks are normalised.
