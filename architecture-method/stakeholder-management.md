## Stakeholder Management

Stakeholder management is an important element in the delivery of any complex project or programme. Effective stakeholder management involves genuinely listening to a range of people and working with them to achieve positive results. It is critical to organisational success and competence, and it's part of our job as civil servants.

This is especially the case when technical or architectural work-streams are included in the range of activities. The [Digital First](http://resources.mygov.scot/standards/digital-first/index.html) service standard requires that the delivery of online services is user centered, transparent and focuses on continuously improving the service based on feedback from users. More generally, the [Scottish Approach to Government](http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2015/04/9736/9) centers around three core elements of:

- **Participation and Co-production**: enabling people to shape and co-design the services they use;
- **Assets-based**: valuing the strengths of people and communities to build social capital and capacity, rather than focusing solely on perceived deficits;
- **Improvement Methodology**: creating the conditions for change and then making the change.

If executed well stakeholder management can be a useful tool to meet these requirements.

The Scottish Government (SG) has a mature, well documented approach to stakeholder management that is both understood and successfully implemented across the organisation. This approach is aligned and integrated with the organisation's overall approach to project and programme management and recognises the need to identify those affected by our work and to engage with them from planning through to delivery. The stakeholder management approach is based on industry standard and, as such, covers similar topics to the TOGAF approach, namely:

- Stakeholder identification;
- Stakeholder analysis and classification;
- Stakeholder prioritisation;
- Stakeholder communications planning.

However, consideration of stakeholders within The Scottish Government goes beyond management to engagement. The broader challenge of stakeholder engagement, particularly sustaining effective relationships that engender trust and open communication over the long-term, is not directly considered within TOGAF. As such, our enterprise and systems architecture framework will re-use the Scottish Government approach rather than the TOGAF approach. In particular we will follow the SG stakeholder engagement lifecycle summarised below.

### Stakeholder Engagement Lifecycle

The following steps are involved in the [SG's approach to stakeholder engagement (intranet)](http://intranet/InExec/AboutUs/Directorates/CommunicationsDirectorat/channel/EffectiveStakeholderEng):

1. **Plan**: think about what you want to achieve, and the stakeholders whose viewpoints you need to consider. Create a list of stakeholders and classify them by influence and interest.
2. **Build understanding**: further analyse the stakeholders on your list considering, for example, their level of commitment, whether they are representative of their peer group and/or whether they are authorised to make decisions.
3. **Engage**: establish a communications strategy based on the analysis that you have undertaken and engage with confidence. This means listening, as well as talking. Engagement methods range from informal phone calls to interviews, focus groups, public meetings, surveys and stakeholder panels.
4. **Build trust**: demonstrate that you have taken on board each stakeholder's suggestions and feedback. Follow up on any corresponding action you have promised and report back to the stakeholder on results.
5. **Evaluate**: invest in stakeholder relationships for the long-term. Document what you have learned so that you can hand over to colleagues, if necessary, in the future. Monitor ongoing relationships â€“ the trust and open communication you have developed can deteriorate quickly if left untended.

### Considerations

The range of stakeholders for a typical technical or architecture project within the Scottish Government can vary from the standard list of stakeholders in the [TOGAF stakeholder map](http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap24.html). Scottish Government stakeholders include the individuals and organisations who affect or are affected by the work we do. They can include:

- Public bodies
- Health authorities
- Faith groups
- Equality organisations
- Environmental groups
- Non-Governmental organisations
- Media representatives
- Local councils
- Members of the public
- Trade unions and trade associations
- The Scottish Parliament
- Suppliers
- Education and training organisations
- Businesses
- Voluntary or welfare organisations
- Pressure groups
- Other Governments
- UK Government departments
- Community leaders
- Community-based organisations like:
    - Youth groups and women's groups
    - Academics
