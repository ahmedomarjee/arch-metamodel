# Business Context

The purpose of this document is to provide a business context for archtiecture work. By business context we primarily mean business principles, business goals and business drivers. It aims to describe factors that exist beyond the direct influence of architecture practice but may very well have a considerable influence over the way that an architecture is established.

## The Scottish Government

The devolved government for Scotland has a range of responsibilities which include: health, education, justice, rural affairs, housing and the environment. Some powers are reserved to the UK government and include: immigration, the constitution, foreign policy and defence.

### National Perfomance Framework

The purpose and strategic objectives of Government are defined in a national performance framework. The framework provides a clear vision for Scotland with broad measures of national wellbeing covering a range of economic, health, social and environmental indicators and targets.

Our vision for a successful Scotland is described and measured in five parts which support and reinforce each other.

- **The Scottish Government's Purpose** sets out the direction and ambition for Scotland
- **Purpose Targets** are high level targets that show progress towards the Purpose
- **Strategic Objectives** describe where we will focus our actions
- **National Outcomes** describe what the Scottish Government wants to achieve and the kind of Scotland we want to see
- **National Indicators** enable us to track progress towards the Purpose and National Outcomes

#### The Scottish Government's Purpose

> To focus government and public services on creating a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth

Our approach to delivering this Purpose is set out in [Scotland's Economic Strategy](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Economy/EconomicStrategy) (SES), published in March 2015. The SES is built around two interdependent pillars: **increasing competitiveness** and **tackling inequality**.

[More details](http://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms/purpose).

#### The Strategic Objectives

One of the Government's first actions on taking office in May 2007 was to streamline the resources of government in order to focus on creating a more successful country.

We aligned the Scottish Government around five Strategic Objectives that underpin our Purpose and describe the kind of Scotland we want to live in - a Scotland that is Wealthier and Fairer, Smarter, Healthier, Safer and Stronger and Greener.

We believe that success lies in focusing all of Government and public services on the achievement of our Purpose. By working together across all of these strategic objectives, we can increase sustainable economic growth so that all of Scotland can flourish.

- **Wealthier and Fairer**
  Enable businesses and people to increase their wealth and more people to share fairly in that wealth.

- **Smarter**
  Expand opportunities for Scots to succeed from nurture through to life long learning ensuring higher and more widely shared achievements.

- **Healthier**
  Help people to sustain and improve their health, especially in disadvantaged communities, ensuring better, local and faster access to health care.

- **Safer and Stronger**
  Help local communities to flourish, becoming stronger, safer place to live, offering improved opportunities and a better quality of life.

- **Greener**
  Improve Scotland's natural and built environment and the sustainable use and enjoyment of it.

#### The National Indicators

National Indicators enable us to track progress towards the achievement of our National Outcomes and ultimately the delivery of the Purpose.

Indicators have been chosen to show how we are progressing on the range of Outcomes. Wherever possible we have selected Indicators that come from existing datasets to allow us to understand progress and trends over time.

The 55 National Indicators do not provide comprehensive measurement of every activity undertaken to achieve the Outcomes and Purpose. Instead they are a carefully chosen set which we believe most clearly shows progress towards the achievement of a more successful and prosperous Scotland.

[More details](http://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms/indicator).

### Scotland Performs

The "[Scotland Performs](http://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/scotPerforms)" website measures and reports on progress of government in Scotland. It allows citizens to judge for themselves how Scotland is doing against a wide range of indicators set out in the National Performance Framework.

### The Programme for Government

The Programme for Government sets out the policies, actions and legislation that we will take forward in order to deliver our core purpose of creating a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and to equip Scotland for the challenges of the next decade and beyond.

## The Digital Directorate

Scottish Government directorates are responsible for progressing the five core strategic objectives. The purpose of the Digital Directorate is to ensure that Scotland is positioned to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the digital age. As such, the primary responsibility of the directorate is to develop the Scottish Government's Digital Strategy and to coordinate its implementation, focusing on four key areas to achieve Scotland's digital ambition:

- **Digital public services**
  Our aim is to accelerate the pace of digital transformation to deliver improved, user-focused digital public services and to drive innovation and efficiency in the Scottish public sector. The digital transformation of public services plays a decisive role in our public service reform programme. Endorsed by all parts of the Scottish public sector, our digital public services strategy positions digital transformation as a key enabler for public service reform.
- **Digital economy**
  By raising the awareness and use of digital technologies and platforms across Scottish businesses, and increasing the supply of skilled women and men which employers will need to deliver these improvements, we will grow Scotland’s economy Digital Economy
- **Digital participation**
  The Scottish Government is committed to increasing digital participation and ensuring that all of Scotland is able to enjoy the social, cultural and economic benefits of the internet. Ensuring that our businesses, whatever their size, and the people of Scotland, whatever their location, age or income, can choose digital first. It is essential that everyone has access to the right technology and are capable and confident in its use at home and at work.
- **Connectivity**
  Digital Connectivity ensuries that everyone in Scotland can access high quality digital connectivity is a priority for the Scottish Government. This underpins our economic strategy – helping our businesses reach new markets; while ensuring that people can work flexibly wherever they are in Scotland. We want Scotland to have world class digital infrastructure that supports high quality digital services anywhere, at any time, on any device.

[Scotland's Digital Future: A Strategy for Scotland](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/03/04162416/0) sets out in more detail how the directorate intends to achieve The Scottish Government's digital ambition. It summarises what we are already doing, and what further actions we propose to take, in the four key areas above. In doing so, it proposes a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to ensuring that Scotland is positioned to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the digital age. It will also help us build the solid infrastructure, skills and competitive base which is an essential element of the Economic Recovery Plan that the Scottish Government published on 24 February 2011.


## Digital Public Services

Delivery of world class digital public services is a key area of focus in order to achieve Scotland's digital ambition. This work is being led by the Digital Public Services & Business Transformation division within the Digital directorate.

The Scottish Government has published [Scotland's Digital Future – Delivery of Public Services](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/09/6272) to outline the strategy by which we will deliver on behalf of the citizens of Scotland. The strategy was developed with and for the Scottish public sector, working with industry, and those who use services. The strategy sets out collective ambitions and National Level Actions to deliver on these and so facilitate action at sector, cluster or organisational level.

### Relationship to National Outcomes

The Scottish Government is working with the wider public sector to achieve:

*public services that are high quality, continually improving, efficient and responsive to local needs* (National Outcome 16).

We do so in a context of unprecedented growth in demand for services and of constrained resources. A future that is both more sustainable and more equal will require the public sector to work with their user communities to redesign services and different parts of the public sector to work better together. The effective, innovative and imaginative deployment of digital technologies gives us tools to meet these challenges.

We see every day how digital technologies and communication are transforming life experiences at home, in social and community networks and in business. Digital technologies are also impacting on how people in Scotland acquire information about public services and access those services. We are not starting from a blank sheet but we have the opportunity for a much bigger transformation to:

- use digital technologies to redesign services and better meet people's needs, including the opportunity for citizens to have more control over when and how they access services;
- deploy digital technologies in ways that reduce the cost of services to the user and provider;
- deliver services and manage data in a way that supports businesses and provides new business opportunities and contributes to economic growth.

### Our Vision and What Success Looks Like

The strategy explains that *when we succeed the people of Scotland will*:

- find it easy to access digital services and be confident in doing so because:
    - services are well designed and useable;
    - there is a choice of channels to access them;
    - assistance is available to those who need it;
- experience services which continually improve because providers act on the feedback and performance analysis that digital technologies allow where needs are complex, receive a response that is coordinated and personalised through effective and appropriate use of information and the supporting technology;
- be confident that services are resilient and that personal information will be kept secure.

The strategy's *vision for Scotland* is a country in which:

- digital technology provides a foundation for innovative, integrated public services that cross organisational boundaries and deliver to those in most need, and for services for business that promote growth;
- digital technology captures patterns of service use and feedback, so that users of public service are more directly involved in service design and improvement;
- this use of digital technologies provides a firm basis for a shared commitment to, and responsibility for, public services.

### Drivers for the Strategy

The business drivers for the strategy fall into three areas.

#### Public Service Reform

The strategy and its implementation will support public service reform that focuses on achieving outcomes and doing so with greater efficiency. The four pillars of reform identified in [Renewing Scotland's Public Services](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/09/21104740) are:

- a decisive shift towards prevention – by helping partners to prioritise and invest in actions that will help prevent problems arising or deal with them early on;
- collaboration and integration – supporting greater integration of public services at a local level by enabling better partnership and collaboration around shared outcomes;
- workforce development and effective leadership – by enabling new ways of working, which make the best use of the talents, capacities and potential of people at all levels, to better involve people and communities in the design of the services that support them;
- improving performance – by supporting a sharp focus on improving performance through greater transparency, innovation and use of digital technology. The strategy will play a key role in creating a more ef cient system of public services (public, third and private sectors) by reducing duplication and sharing services.

Digital public services and cost effective use of ICT will play a crucial role in all four pillars.

#### Effective Use of Resources

The [Scottish Government's Response to the McClelland Review of ICT Infrastructure in the Public Sector in Scotland](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/09/21103403) committed to achieve better value through collaboration and sharing of ICT infrastructure and digital connectivity, and budgets were adjusted to reflect the identified savings. This strategy sets out how savings will be made and tracked. John McClelland’s report also illustrated the bene ts to be gained from using ICT in making services more effective and easier to access. His report set out the landscape in 2011 which already included a range of important initiatives but from which the public sector must continue to move forward.

#### Scotland’s Digital Future

The [Scottish Economic Recovery Plan: Update February 2011](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/02/24095442), identified the opportunity to use ICT more innovatively to improve productivity and help increase economic growth. The public sector will contribute by ensuring that business can deal digitally with the public sector in an effective and ef cient manner and by open data providing a basis for new products and services. In this way we will support National Outcome 1: '*We live in a Scotland that is the most attractive place for doing business in Europe*''.

###  Priority Actions

Priority actions have been developed and refined as our policy thinking has moved forward and as we try to keep pace with the fast moving technology developments. We continue to update an Action Plan which summarises our actions to date and outlines how proposals have been refined, implemented or refocused. The plan includes a forward look to 2020 and the National Level Actions are summarised into the following areas:

- Developing a national digital ecosystem
- User needs
- Make more effective use of data
- Our services
- Our workforce

See the [latest version of the action plan](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/plan) for further details.
