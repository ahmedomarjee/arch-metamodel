# Architecture Metamodel

An architecture metamodel is an element of an architecture repository that describes how a specific organisation has tailored an architecture framework (such as TOGAF) top meet their specific needs.

The material in this repository is authored for use by the Scottish Government's DPS&BT division but is based on general best practice and will likely be useful in other contexts too.
